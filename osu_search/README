Oh hi, won't you please come in...

WHAT IS IT?
==============================
  OSU Search is a Drupal module that embeds OSU search results into the site.
  It is at YOUR_SITE/search once the module is installed.  In addition to
  searching YOUR_SITE, it also offers the option to search all of OSU, and
  an optional "other" site.  (Please see "HOW?" on how to set up the "other"
  site.)  The OSU and "other" searches will be redirected to the normal OSU
  search site.

  This module was developed and tested with Drupal 5.x.  It requires PHP 5
  as well.


HOW?
==============================
  The module comes with a set of default configuration values that should
  work with the OSU search engine (powered by Nutch(r)) without any set up.

  However, if you want to use another search engine (assuming it accepts the
  same HTTP GET variables and uses the same XML schema--good luck!) or want 
  transform the XML output differently, change the values in 
  osu_search.config.inc.

  $GLOBALS['osu_search_url'] is the web path of the search site.  
  $GLOBALS['osu_search_xml_source'] is the web path for XML output.  This
  is the same as $GLOBALS['osu_search_url'] by default.
  $GLOBALS['osu_search_xsl_file'] is the location of the XSL file for 
  transforming the XML output into HTML for the embedded results.

  To set up the "other" site, go to YOUR_SITE/admin/settings/osu_search.  The
  site title is the label text used for the radio button on the search form. 
  If the site title is empty, then the site url will be used.

  The module also has a set of CSS ids and classes that a Drupal theme can 
  overwite.  See osu_search.css for the default styles.  Keep in mind that some
  of the ids and classes are dependent on the XSL used.

  OSU Search provides a way to add a simple search form to templates.  Add the
  following lines of PHP code to template.php in your theme's root directory,
  in the _phptemplate_variables() function:

    if (module_exists('osu_search')) {
        osu_search_get_template_form($vars);
    }

  for all the hooks you need.  For example, if you need it for page.tmpl.php,
  the code in template.php would look something like: 

    function _phptemplate_variables($hook, $vars) {
      if ($hook == 'page') {
        if (module_exists('osu_search')) {
            osu_search_get_template_form($vars);
        }
        return $vars;
      }
      return array();
    }

  in addition to any existent code.  Then the variable $osu_search_form will be
  available in page.tmpl.php.
